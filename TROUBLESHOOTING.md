# 🚨 Codespace Startup Troubleshooting

If you encountered the error "The workbench failed to connect to the server", here are the fixes that have been applied:

## ✅ Issues Fixed

1. **JSON Comments Removed**: Removed all comments from `devcontainer.json` (JSON doesn't support comments)
2. **Simplified Extensions**: Reduced VS Code extensions to avoid potential conflicts
3. **User Permissions**: Changed to `root` user to avoid permission issues
4. **Docker Volumes**: Simplified volume mounting with read-only flags
5. **MySQL Health Checks**: Added proper health checks for service dependencies
6. **Setup Script**: Improved error handling and timeout management
7. **Apache Configuration**: Simplified Apache config for better compatibility

## 🔄 How to Test the Fix

1. **Delete the old Codespace** (if it exists):
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Code" → "Codespaces"
   - Delete any existing Codespace

2. **Create a new Codespace**:
   - Click "Code" → "Codespaces" → "Create codespace on main"
   - Wait 3-5 minutes for complete setup

3. **Verify Services**:
   - Check that all ports are forwarded (80, 443, 3306, 8080)
   - Visit `http://localhost/welcome.html`
   - Test `http://localhost:8080` for phpMyAdmin

## 🛠️ If Issues Persist

### Check Container Logs
```bash
# In the Codespace terminal
docker-compose logs web
docker-compose logs mysql
docker-compose logs phpmyadmin
```

### Manual Service Restart
```bash
# If services aren't running
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### Check Service Status
```bash
# Check if all containers are running
docker-compose ps
```

## 📋 Expected Behavior

After successful startup, you should see:
- ✅ Apache running on port 80/443
- ✅ MySQL running on port 3306
- ✅ phpMyAdmin accessible on port 8080
- ✅ All sample files accessible

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

1. Try creating the Codespace again
2. Check GitHub Codespaces status page
3. Ensure you have sufficient Codespace hours
4. Contact your instructor with error details
